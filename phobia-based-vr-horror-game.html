                    <p class="project-overview">This game is an immersive VR horror experience that pushes the boundaries of fear by targeting common phobias without relying on jumpscares or deadly situations. Set in a dark, flooded cave system, players face a series of uncomfortable and terrifying scenarios designed to trigger deep-seated anxieties. To ensure maximum potential, I have drawn inspiration from the developer commentary of <b>Half-Life: Alyx,</b> which helped significantly in designing the game.</p>
                    <p class="project-overview">VR technology, with its 3D vision capabilities, offers distinctive opportunities for incorporating horror elements, such as the sensations of height, confined spaces, and the unnerving feeling of bugs crawling on the player's face. The game features 15 carefully crafted sections, each aiming to evoke a specific emotional response, resulting in a heart-pounding journey through the depths of players' fears.</p>
                    <p class="project-overview"><b>The first part</b> is tailored to trigger claustrophobic individuals by forcing them to navigate through a flooded, narrow cave system with water levels gradually rising. <b>The second part</b> focuses on the fear of heights, where players must walk along a narrow cliff edge while encountering enormous spiders. <b>The third part</b> follows a bug theme, requiring the player to crawl through cobwebs with spiders and ultimately experiencing a spider crawling on their face. Afterward, a simple relief area is provided as the experience comes to an end.</p>

                <h2 class="section-name">Teacher Feedback</h2>
                <div class="align-with-projects">
                    <p><b>Strengths:</b> That was a bloody incredible experience! Everything from the concept, to design, to 
                        implementation, is absolutely solid. This is created as a multi-sensory experience that uses every trick 
                        in the book to plant a living and breathing world inside the users' mind, causing a deep instinctual 
                        response. What is perhaps the most impressive here is how convincingly all the different elements tie 
                        together to strengthen the illusion, including super subtle details like the handheld phone, wet 
                        surfaces, crawling insects, dripping water effects and distant sounds. The sound should be mentioned 
                        here as a particular achievement on its own, the mix of sounds is perfect and the effects such as 
                        localization and reverb makes it all so believable. This must have taken a lot of effort to put together, 
                        and a lot of iteration and refinement. Congratulations, what an achievement!</p>
                    <p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Seriously hard to pick on anything here. I kind of wished the experience could have lasted longer and that 
                        I could have done more in that last cave, but given the time constraints, you have already delivered 
                        something more refined than was expected.</p>
